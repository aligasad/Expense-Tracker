In this project, I first created a login page and a sign up page. If a user signs up, his data will be saved in local storage, after which he can sign in directly at anytime.

After that I created 5 different pages in which the first page was General Purpose Expense Tracker in which I added Expense Tracker Data Visualization, AI Financial Advisor and Taxes Calculator functionality. I have also done the same work in the start up company Expense Tracker.

After that I created AI support in which I used Google Gemini API.

After that I created Expenses Notes in which the user can make notes of his expenses. I have also stored its data in local storage so that the user can view his notes anytime later.

The last page is Chat with Financial Experts where the user can deal with experts.
